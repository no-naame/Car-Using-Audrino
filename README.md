How to make Robo Car

Items required:
Arduino Uno
HC-05 Bluetooth Module
L298N Motor driver Module
Bo Motor with Tyre
Castor 360 wheel
12 Volt Battery with connector 
Jumper cables(f-f, m-m, m-f)
Fibre board

Cost of build:
Arduino Uno x 1 = 850/-
HC-05 Bluetooth Module x 1 = 250/-
L298N Motor driver Module x 1 = 150/-
Bo Motor with Tyre x 2 = 220/-
Castor 360 wheel x 1 = 30/-
12 Volt Battery with connector x 1 = 50/-
Jumper cables x 15 = 30/-
Fibre board x 1 = 20/-
Total cost: 1600/-

Problems I faced:
It was my first time working on some Hardware project so I faced some difficulties during the time like not giving the proper voltage and making lots of errors , etc

Application used:
Bluetooth RC Controller (Control your car)
Arduino IDE (Put you code in the microcontroller)
